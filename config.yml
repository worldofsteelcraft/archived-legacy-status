  # Before setting up your systems, you need
  # to first define at least one category.
  #
  # Categories are shown in the order that
  # you define in this config file.
  #
  # Categories can have a:
  # - name
  # - description
  # - closed boolean `closed: true`
  #   That would collapse the category upon first load
  #   and the user can expand by clicking on the category
  #   (Requires JavaScript.)
  # - untitled boolean `untitled: true`
  #   This would complerely hide the name of the category.
  #   This is useful, if you do not want to use categories
  #   because you need to set an 'Uncategorized' category.
  #   Or it can be used alongside other categories.
  #
  # These are case sensitive.
  # 
  # For help, see the wiki:
  # https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki/Customization
